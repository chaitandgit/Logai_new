I have a ml_delta.jsonl file that contains structured logs from Drain3 clustering.
Each line is a JSON object with at least the following fields:
	•	device_id
	•	template_id
	•	template_frequency
	•	timestamp (or orig_timestamp)
	•	log_level_text

I want to run anomaly detection using LogAI’s Isolation Forest.
Please generate a Python script that:
	1.	Loads ml_delta.jsonl
	2.	Converts timestamp to numeric format (e.g., epoch seconds)
	3.	Extracts relevant features for anomaly detection
	4.	Initializes and fits an Isolation Forest model using LogAI
	5.	Predicts anomalies and adds is_anomaly column
	6.	Saves the results to a .parquet or .jsonl file

Optional: show how to visualize or summarize the anomaly rate per device_id.

I want the script to run anomaly detection per device, and also generate a combined output across all devices.
Please:
	•	Split the input by device_id
	•	Run Isolation Forest on each device’s logs separately
	•	Append results with is_anomaly field
	•	Write:
	•	One output file per device (e.g., D93LA9ME001025_results.parquet)
	•	One combined results file (e.g., combined_results.parquet)
