“I’m giving you logs already clustered via Drain3, with template_id, device_id, timestamp, etc. I want to extract structured features for ML anomaly detection in LogAI.”

- template_id (hash) – as unique log signature
- log_level_code and log_level_text – e.g. L1/L2, ALERT/WARNING
- device_id – as categorical input
- template_frequency – count of occurrences (time-aware if possible)
- timestamp – as numerical value (e.g. seconds, float)
- delta_since_last_seen – optional time difference between log entries
- logline sample – optional for human readability


“Please make sure each row has: template_id, device_id, log_level_code, log_level_text, template_frequency, timestamp (float or ISO), and optionally a sample_log. I don’t need the full raw logline unless you’re using it for embeddings.”

	•	🚫 “Avoid putting <TIME> or <PATH> placeholders in extracted features — keep those for the template only.”
	•	🚫 “Don’t hardcode is_anomaly: false — leave it blank or let LogAI predict it.”
	•	🚫 “Don’t skip log_level if the log template has wildcards — use a fallback like ‘UNKNOWN’.”


“Can you also calculate delta_time between first_seen and last_seen for each template as a new feature?”

“Or derive hour_of_day or day_of_week from the timestamp?”

These help detect seasonal anomalies (e.g., spikes at odd hours).

I have clustered logs in JSON format from Drain3. Each JSON object includes fields like:
	•	template_id
	•	template (with <TIME>, <PATH>, etc.)
	•	device_id
	•	log_level_code (e.g., L1, L5)
	•	log_level_text (e.g., ALERT, NOTICE)
	•	first_seen and last_seen timestamps
	•	sample_logs

I want to extract a CSV file with one row per log template instance that is compatible with LogAI’s anomaly detection pipeline.

Please do the following:

✅ Required columns
	•	logline: One representative example from sample_logs
	•	_id: Autoincrement or UUID (optional fallback)
	•	device_id: Use as-is
	•	template_id: Use as-is
	•	log_level_text: Use as-is; fallback to “UNKNOWN” if missing
	•	template_frequency: Use count or template_frequency
	•	timestamp: Use first_seen or orig_timestamp, converted to a float (e.g., Unix timestamp or seconds since epoch)

🧠 Optional fields (only if you can compute)
	•	log_level_code
	•	delta_time: seconds between last_seen and first_seen
	•	hour_of_day, day_of_week: from timestamp

⚠️ Rules
	•	Don’t hardcode is_anomaly — leave it blank or set False if needed
	•	If the log has <*> wildcards in place of log level, still try to guess the level from sample_logs, or use UNKNOWN
	•	Format must be clean CSV: headers present, UTF-8-safe, ready for pandas/LogAI
	•	Each row = one occurrence of a clustered template
	•	Use floating point timestamp (e.g., 1724645296.09193) or formatted ISO if LogAI expects that

Output only the final CSV (or a preview of top 5 lines), and validate types are correct.




Extract features from clustered JSON logs for ML-based anomaly detection. For each log:
- Include: template_id, device_id, log_level_code, log_level_text, template_frequency, sample_logs[0]
- Convert timestamp (orig_timestamp or first_seen) into a float: seconds from beginning of day or from the first log
- Add is_anomaly field (set False by default)
- Include a column named logline using the sample_logs[0]
- If the template has too many wildcards (e.g. >= 3), mark suspicious = True
- Normalize log_level_code (L1-L7) into numeric scale if possible
- Remove timezone from timestamp or convert to UTC
Output a CSV or Pandas DataFrame with these fields:
logline, _id, is_anomaly, device_id, template_id, log_level_text, template_frequency, timestamp


	•	Create a column for wildcard_count (count of <*> in the template)
	•	Add flags for unusual combinations (e.g. L1 but low frequency)
	•	Sort logs by timestamp before exporting for model input
	•	Use SHA1 of template_id + device_id as _id if needed
