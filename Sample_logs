“Now I want to run anomaly detection using LogAI.
My input is a .csv file of extracted features or raw clustered logs (JSONL or Parquet).
I want to use the Isolation Forest algorithm.

Please generate a Python script that:
	•	Loads the clustered log data or features from file
	•	Uses LogAI to detect anomalies using Isolation Forest
	•	Appends a new column is_anomaly to the dataset
	•	Saves the results to a .parquet or .jsonl file

If needed, preprocess timestamp into numeric format, and normalize any numeric fields.
Show me how to configure the model using LogAI’s config or API.
Also show how to view the number of detected anomalies per device.”
